    abstract = { While they have long been a subject of academic study, social virtual reality (SVR) systems are now attracting increasingly large audiences on current consumer virtual reality systems. The design space of SVR systems is very large, and relatively little is known about how these systems should be constructed in order to be usable and efficient. In this paper we present Ubiq, a toolkit that focuses on facilitating the construction of SVR systems. We argue for the design strategy of Ubiq and its scope. Ubiq is built on the Unity platform. It provides core functionality of many SVR systems such as connection management, voice, avatars, etc. However, its design remains easy to extend. We demonstrate examples built on Ubiq and how it has been successfully used in classroom teaching. Ubiq is open source (Apache License) and thus enables several use cases that commercial systems cannot.},

  title = "State of the art on 3D reconstruction with RGB-D cameras",
  abstract = "The advent of affordable consumer grade RGB-D cameras has brought about a profound advancement of visual scene reconstruction methods. Both computer graphics and computer vision researchers spend significant effort to develop entirely new algorithms to capture comprehensive shape models of static and dynamic scenes with RGB-D cameras. This led to significant advances of the state of the art along several dimensions. Some methods achieve very high reconstruction detail, despite limited sensor resolution. Others even achieve real-time performance, yet possibly at lower quality. New concepts were developed to capture scenes at larger spatial and temporal extent. Other recent algorithms flank shape reconstruction with concurrent material and lighting estimation, even in general scenes and unconstrained conditions. In this state-of-the-art report, we analyze these recent developments in RGB-D scene reconstruction in detail and review essential related work. We explain, compare, and critically analyze the common underlying algorithmic concepts that enabled these recent advancements. Furthermore, we show how algorithms are designed to best exploit the benefits of RGB-D data while suppressing their often non-trivial data distortions. In addition, this report identifies and discusses important open research questions and suggests relevant directions for future work.",

  abstract = {Radiance Field methods have recently revolutionized novel-view synthesis of scenes captured with multiple photos or videos. However, achieving high visual quality still requires neural networks that are costly to train and render, while recent faster methods inevitably trade off speed for quality. For unbounded and complete scenes (rather than isolated objects) and 1080p resolution rendering, no current method can achieve real-time display rates. We introduce three key elements that allow us to achieve state-of-the-art visual quality while maintaining competitive training times and importantly allow high-quality real-time (≥ 30 fps) novel-view synthesis at 1080p resolution. First, starting from sparse points produced during camera calibration, we represent the scene with 3D Gaussians that preserve desirable properties of continuous volumetric radiance fields for scene optimization while avoiding unnecessary computation in empty space; Second, we perform interleaved optimization/density control of the 3D Gaussians, notably optimizing anisotropic covariance to achieve an accurate representation of the scene; Third, we develop a fast visibility-aware rendering algorithm that supports anisotropic splatting and both accelerates training and allows realtime rendering. We demonstrate state-of-the-art visual quality and real-time rendering on several established datasets.},
